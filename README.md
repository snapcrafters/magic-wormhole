## Remaining tasks

Snapcrafters ([join us](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/join-snapcrafters/1325)) 
are working to land snap install documentation and
the [snapcraft.yaml](https://github.com/snapcrafters/fork-and-rename-me/blob/master/snap/snapcraft.yaml)
upstream so Magic Wormhole can authoritatively publish future releases.

  - [x] Fork the [Snapcrafters template](https://github.com/snapcrafters/fork-and-rename-me) repository to your own GitHub account.
    - If you have already forked the Snapcrafter template to your account and want to create another snap, you'll need to use GitHub's [Import repository](https://github.com/new/import) feature because you can only fork a repository once.
  - [x] Rename the forked Snapcrafters template repository

  - [x] Update logos and references to `[Project]` and `[my-snap-name]`

  - [x] Publish the `devmode` snap in the Snap store edge channel
  - [x] Add install instructions to this `README.md`

  - [x] Convert the snap to `strict` confinement, or `classic` confinement if it qualifies
  - [x] Publish the confined snap in the Snap store beta channel
  - [x] Update the install instructions in this `README.md`
  - [x] Post a call for testing on the [Snapcraft Forum](https://forum.snapcraft.io) - [link]()
  - [x] Make a post in the [Snapcraft Forum](https://forum.snapcraft.io) asking for a transfer of the snap name from you to snapcrafters - [link]()
  - [x] Ask a [Snapcrafters admin](https://github.com/orgs/snapcrafters/people?query=%20role%3Aowner) to fork your repo into github.com/snapcrafters, and configure the repo for automatic publishing into edge on commit
  - [ ] Add the provided Snapcraft build badge to this `README.md`
  - [x] Publish the snap in the Snap store stable channel
  - [x] Update the install instructions in this `README.md`
