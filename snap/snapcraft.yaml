summary: get things from one computer to another, safely
description: |
  This package provides a library and a command-line tool named wormhole, which
  makes it possible to get arbitrary-sized files and directories (or short
  pieces of text) from one computer to another. The two endpoints are identified
  by using identical "wormhole codes": in general, the sending machine generates
  and displays the code, which must then be typed into the receiving machine.
